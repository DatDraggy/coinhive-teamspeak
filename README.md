# Coinhive Monero Miner TeamSpeak3 Integration

Let your TeamSpeak users mine Monero for you with one quick registration without having to download anything.

Users will receive a special TeamSpeak group upon reaching a customisable amount of hashes.

Finding security related bugs will be rewarded in ZenCash.

## Dependencies

What you need to use this project:
1. Webserver + PHP + MySQL Server
2. TeamSpeak3 Server
3. [coinhive.com](https://coinhive.com) Account
4. Domain (optional)

## How to use
1. Put all files on your webserver
2. Import coinhive_teamspeak.sql into your mysql server. You can use PHPMyAdmin or the terminal

   `mysql -u username -p coinhive_teamspeak < /path/to/file/coinhive_teamspeak.sql`

3. Go to [coinhive.com](https://coinhive.com) and create an account.
4. After logging in, click "settings" in the top right corner.
5. Select "Sites & API Keys"
6. Create a new site and copy your Secret Key (private) to config.php 
Warning: Make sure that there is no space and that the key is correct! Otherwise it won't show the remaining hashes.
7. Copy Site Key to miner.html on line 113
8. Fill out the rest of config.php
9. Create directory called "log" in hive and set permissions to 777 if you want to enable sql error logging.

If you setup everything correctly you should be able to register and start mining by visiting miner.html on your domain.

#### Upgrading
If only the last digit of the version increased, there is no need to re-do the configuration. Only if the first or second (vFirst.Second.Third) changed.

Example: 

Old version v1.1.0, new version v1.1.1: You can use your old configuration

Old version v1.1.0, new version v1.2.0: Re-do (recommended) or edit your configuration

#### Support
I will try to assist you as good as I can in the [issues tab](https://github.com/DatDraggy/coinhive-teamspeak/issues) if you need any help. 

Please don't forget to mention your webserver version (apache, nginx, etc) and when you downloaded the script. 
That makes it a little easier.

If errors occur, they will (hopefully) show in the browsers console. If you or me can't find the error, please enable "display_errors" by putting `display_errors = on` at the bottom of your php.ini file.
